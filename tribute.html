    <h1>My Inspiration: Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</h1>

    <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, known as the 'Missile Man of India', has been a true source of inspiration to millions. His dedication to science, humble nature, and love for students made him not only a great scientist but also a beloved leader.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I admire most about him is his humility despite achieving great success. Coming from a modest background and rising to become the President of India proves that hard work and determination can overcome any obstacle.
    </p>

    <h2>Life Lessons</h2>
    <p>
      He taught us to dream big and work consistently toward our goals. One of his famous quotes, <strong>"Dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let you sleep."</strong> motivates me to keep moving forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      His life is a shining example of how values, integrity, and passion can make a lasting impact on society.
